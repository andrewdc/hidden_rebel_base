Well, what can I say. I use StaticMatic to generate rapid UI prototypes and every-time I start a new one I find myself having to re-do my _base.sass partial file, or paste it from a previous project. Hunting around for it gets kind of annoying. 

It makes more sense to put this file in Git so that I can keep it updated and pull/push it from a public source. Feel free to fork this, add, steal - whatever you would like!
